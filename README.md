ðŸš€ **Project Showcase: Star War Army Product Slider** ðŸš€

I'm excited to present my latest project: **Star War Army Product Slider**! This visually stunning product slider is built using JavaScript (20%), CSS (60%), and HTML (20%).

**Project Highlights:**
- **Interactive JavaScript Features:** Utilizes JavaScript to create smooth and dynamic interactions, enhancing user engagement.
- **Elegant CSS Design:** Employs CSS extensively to provide a visually appealing and immersive design, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Structured HTML Layout:** Uses HTML to structure the slider's content effectively, maintaining a clean and semantic layout.

The Star War Army Product Slider showcases my ability to create interactive and visually compelling web components with a strong emphasis on design and user experience.
